     *   ! For Internet Domain sockets (AF_INET) such as
     *     TCP and UDP, the target portion of the socketUri

     *     followed by a colon and a port number.

     *     point to the socket file on the filesystem
     *
     * Note: The stream will by default be opened in blocking mode.
     *
     * Warning UDP sockets will sometimes appear to have opened without
     * an error, even if the remote host is unreachable. The error will
     * only become apparent when you read or write data to/from the socket.
     * The reason for this is because UDP is a "connectionless" protocol,
     * which means that the operating system does not try to establish a
     * link for the socket until it actually needs to send or receive data
